# Intro

Hi, I’m Robinson. In this course my goal is for you to learn all the fundamental knowledge of Python.

I spent a lot of time last year trying to learn Python, yet the reality is that we’re in the AI era. So, how should we learn in this era when most code is generated by AI?

My first advice for you: turn off autocomplete, deactivate AI tools, and try to solve your first LeetCode exercise right now, or maybe after completing this course.

My second piece of advice is that writing is very different from reading. Perhaps in the future, you will only need to read code to create better prompts, but the ability to write is similar to solving math problems. What is the use? I don’t know, but it’s fundamental.

Let’s go, friends! If you have any questions, you can send me a message on my social media. Check the link [social media].

How to write Python code? Syntax is the first step. In the past, the initiation was writing a "Hello World" message, but I have two pieces of news.

The first is that you don’t need to write a “Hello World” anymore; now you should write a functional application. This is the new “Hello World.”

Don’t worry, friend, I’m going to help you with this goal. Let's get to work!

I’m going to do a speedrun of all the fundamental concepts and then I’m going to show you many examples and challenges to apply your new knowledge.
